# Front end

## What I will forget
- `useRef`: persist values between renders. Does not cause a rerender when updated [geek for geeks useRef](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_useref.asp)<br>
"Manipulate DOM without tri"<br>
"Put into ref of some element"
- test string match patter, using regex, like `/^[A-z][A-z0-9-_]{3,23}$/`
- `aria-live="assertive"`. When we set the focus on this element to the ref. It will be announced with screen reader
- `for` attribute of label and `id` of input
- `aria-describedby` provide another element that describe input field
